undefined
 - When a variable is declared but not initialized, or when a function does not return a value, the variable or the functionâ€™s result is undefined.
 - Accessing an object property or array element that does not exist also results in undefined.
 - It is a primitive value.


// ================ code ================
let x; // variable declared but not initialized
console.log(x); // Output: undefined

function doSomething() {
// no return statement, so the function returns undefined
}
console.log(doSomething()); // Output: undefined

let obj = {};
console.log(obj.property); // Output: undefined


a. Variable Declaration: variable without initializing it, its value is automatically set to undefined. This is normal and expected behavior.
let x;
console.log(x); // Output: undefined

b. Function Return Values: If a function does not explicitly return a value, its return value is undefined. This is also normal and expected behavior.

function foo() {
    // No return statement
}
console.log(foo()); // Output: undefined

c. Accessing Non-existent Object Properties: When you try to access a property of an object that does not exist, you'll get undefined. This can be useful for checking if a property exists or not.

let obj = {};
console.log(obj.nonExistentProperty); // Output: undefined




null
 - It is a deliberate assignment that represents the absence of any object value.
 - It is often used to explicitly indicate that a variable or object property should have no value or no reference to any object.
 - It is also a primitive value.
Example: In the example, we have shown null.

// ================ code ================
let y = null; // variable intentionally set to null
console.log(y); // Output: null

let obj = { property: null }; // property intentionally set to null
console.log(obj.property); // Output: null



 null == undefined // true
 null === undefined // false

Undefined	Null
Undefined means a variable has been declared but has yet not been assigned a value.	Null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.
