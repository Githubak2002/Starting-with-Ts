=== JS is a single-threaded language ===
meaning it has only one call stack and one memory heap. This single-threaded nature refers to the fact that JavaScript executes code in a linear fashion, one statement at a time, from top to bottom.

=== Node js ? ===
runtime environment that allows you to run js code on the server-side, outside of a web browser. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine used by Google Chrome, to execute JavaScript code.

Key Points about Node.js:

Server-Side JavaScript:
used for server-side scripting

Event-Driven and Non-Blocking I/O Model:
can handle multiple requests concurrently without getting blocked

NPM (Node Package Manager):
Node.js comes with NPM, a package manager that allows developers to easily install, manage, and share third-party libraries (packages) and tools for building applications.
Use Cases:

Node.js is well-suited for building real-time applications (like chat applications or streaming services) and APIs.
It's also used for building server-side web applications and microservices architecture.
Node.js is popular in the development of tools and utilities for front-end developers (e.g., build tools, task runners).

Advantages:
Simplifies development by allowing developers to use the same language (JavaScript) both on the client-side and server-side.
Provides a rich ecosystem of libraries and modules through NPM.
High performance due to its event-driven, non-blocking architecture.
